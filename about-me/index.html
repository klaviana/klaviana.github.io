            <p align="left">Hi, I'm Kyle. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="text">
            <p align="left">Currently I am a Master's student at Stanford University studying Music, Science, 
                and Technology at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA). Previously,
                I completed a B.S. at Stanford in Symbolic Systems with a concentration in interactive design,
                completing coursework in computer science, cognitive science, and applied statistics.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p align="left">I am passionate about the intersection between design, technology, and music, and
                my current research explores their integration. Recent projects include an interactive web
                program for music education and a music controller that features unique degrees of musical expression.
                Projects I intend to explore this coming year include designing algorithms for artifically intelligent 
                music composition as well as creating VR spaces for musical expression. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p align="left">The past three summers I have worked as a counselor at Stanford Sierra Camp, where I 
                have come to appreciate the importance of human-centered design (and made some of my best friends
                along the way). I am always looking to meet new people and hear about what they are passionate about.
