            <p align="left">Hi, I'm Kyle. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="text">
            <p align="left">I recently graduated from Stanford University with an M.A. in Music Science and Technology 
                at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA). Here I had the opportunity to study 
                audio signal processing, embedded systems, ambisonics, and design for audio-visual software applications.
                
                Previously, I completed a B.S. at Stanford in Symbolic Systems with a concentration in 
                interaction design, completing coursework in computer science, cognitive science, and applied statistics.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p align="left">My professional interests lie at the intersection of software development and user-centered 
                product design. I enjoy the creation of products from the initial ideation stage, through prototyping 
                and user research, to developing algorithms and implementing them technically. I adhere 
                strongly to the philosophy of lateral thinking, wherein it is considered better practice to iterate 
                through ideas early in the process rather than dig too deep down the rabbit hole only to realize the 
                design you chose is flawed or the algorithm you implemented is inefficient. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p align="left">The past four summers I have worked as a counselor at Stanford Sierra Camp, where I have come 
                to appreciate the importance of leadership and team-building in the workplace (and made some of my best 
                friends along the way). 
                
                I am always looking to meet new people and hear about what they are passionate about.
